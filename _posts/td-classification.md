In an ever increasing bid to generate more revenue and profits, banks and other financial institutions have begun utilising data analytics to ensure that they deliver the right product or offer to their customers at the right time. This project's dataset was taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
