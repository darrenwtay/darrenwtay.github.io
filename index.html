<p>As someone who loves to curl up with a good book, I have always been on the hunt for the next good read. Instead of waiting for new books written by authors that I enjoy reading (Orson Scott Card, Brandon Sanderson and Jim Butcher, to name a few), I decided to try my hand at building a book recommender system.</p>
    
<p>After scouring the Internet for a dataset to work with, I finally settled on using a dataset of 10k books and almost 1 million ratings that was posted on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k">Kaggle</a>.</p>

<p>The recommender system applies user-user collaborative filtering as well as content-based filtering which were some of the techniques that were taught near the end of my Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly.</p>
    
<p> <b> Update: </b> (15 April 2019) Included item-item collaborative filtering to the code </p>

<p>Capstone project for my 12-week Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly. I wanted to be able to apply what I had learned to a real world business problem in the banking/finance industry from which I have a background in.</p>
    
<p>In an ever increasing bid to generate more revenue and profits, banks and other financial institutions have begun utilising data analytics to ensure that they deliver the right product or offer to their customers at the right time. This project's dataset was taken from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>

<p>The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.</p>
